Pre-Work-CTD / The Star Wars Repository

This project uses HTML, CSS and Java Script.

In this project you will be able to navigate (in a crazy and cool way) inside the universe of Star Wars and find some information about the Films and Characters.
You can scroll and enjoy the animation or click in any Film/Character to read the information you want.
